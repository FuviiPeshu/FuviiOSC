# Fuvii's Modules

A small collection of useful VRCOSC modules!

## 📦 How to Install

This repository contains files designed to be used with the [VRCOSC](https://github.com/VolcanicArts/VRCOSC) app.
Follow the instructions there and after launching the program the modules should appear in the first tab (Package Download) as **"Fuvii's Modules"**. 
From there, simply download the latest version and enjoy!

### 🔁 Avatar Changer

The Avatar Changer listens for specific OSC parameters and compares them against user-defined conditions. When a match is found, it automatically switches to the associated avatar ID.
This is made possible thanks to the [VRChat 2025.1.2 update](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/vrchat-202512#changes--fixes).

*Note: This feature currently works **ONLY FOR FAVOURITED** avatars!
